The non-malicious simulation is designed to trigger detections by Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and Antivirus (AV) systems, providing a practical exercise to enhance purple teaming skills. The simulation includes a simple Python-based listening server for command and control (C2) and a simulated malware component developed in Nim.\n\n**Projects**\nDuring this time anyone in attendance is free to share an update on a project or hobby they are working on.\n\n**CTF Planning**\nThere will be a time to collaborate for those involved in planning capture the flag (CTF) events for up-coming conferences.",
