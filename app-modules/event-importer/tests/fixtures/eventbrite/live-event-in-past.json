The goal is to expand the spectrum of conversation beyond the traditional confines of space and time.  It creates opportunities for individuals to both present and participate in an intimate atmosphere that encourages collaboration. It is an intense event with discussions, demos, and interaction from participants. It is where conversations for the next-big-thing are happening. \nThis will be an all day event which will kick off with our opening keynote being delivered by Tim Tomes (@LaNMaSteR53), Upstate native and author of the extremely popular recon-ng open source tool (amongst others).\nThe main event page can be found at https://goo.gl/HSKBt4.\n\n",
