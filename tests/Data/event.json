  "description": "Join other civic tech volunteers from across the Carolinas for a Remote Mapping Party for our Open Sidewalks project. At these bi-weekly sessions, Code for the Carolinas volunteers work together to complete our project of mapping pedestrian access features in Downtown Raleigh. The area we are mapping is an important hub for public transit, state government, and recreation. This project is a partnership with the [Taskar Center for Accessible Technology at the University of Washington](<a href=\"https://tcat.cs.washington.edu/\" class=\"linkified\">https://tcat.cs.washington.edu/</a>). The project involves using aerial imagery to code maps and metadata about features that make streets accessible to pedestrians--especially features that are important for pedestrians who face barriers to mobility and use wheelchairs or walkers. Even if you're new to this project and/or civic tech volunteering, you're welcome to join the meeting. Visitors are always welcome and no technical skills are needed. You can find information about the project, including orientation videos from the Taskar Center, [in our Slack Workspace](<a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/codeforthecarolinas/shared_invite/zt-1kxuwu05x-3KxOpkOYjAuN5yuOAH8ROg\" class=\"linkified\">https://join.slack.com/t/codeforthecarolinas/shared_invite/zt-1kxuwu05x-3KxOpkOYjAuN5yuOAH8ROg</a>) in the #project-open-sidewalks channel.
