                    HackGreenville is dedicated to providing a welcoming and harassment-free community and events for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of our community members in any form.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The following Code of Conduct extends to all HackGreenville online activity (our Slack community, the HackGreenville website, the HackGreenville Github, etc) and in-person events. Anyone found to be violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community online platforms or events at the discretion of the moderators and event organizers.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing images or recordings, sustained disruption of online discussion, talks, or other events, inappropriate physical contact, unwelcome sexual attention, spam, personal attacks, trolling or other anti-social behavior. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior (by organizers or anyone) are expected to comply immediately.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the HackGreenville moderators and/or event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the virtual platform or event. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a moderator of HackGreenville and/or event organizer immediately.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    HackGreenville board, moderators and event organizers will be happy to help participants contact security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe in our virtual platforms and at our events. We value your participation and strive to provide the most welcoming community experiences.
                </p>
