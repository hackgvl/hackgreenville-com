# HackGreenville
The official repository for Greenville, SC's tech community website, maintained by [Code for Greenville](https://github.com/codeforgreenville).

https://hackgreenville.com

Find us on [Slack](https://hackgreenville.slack.com/)!

## Purpose
Our goal is to connect people to the tech-related community in the Greenville area. We currently do this by providing information on meetups and tech organizations in the area, as well as directing people to the HackGreenville slack signup page.

The meetup information is queried from the [Upstate Tech Cal Service](https://github.com/codeforgreenville/upstate_tech_cal_service).

The organization information is queried from Code for Greenville's [API](https://github.com/codeforgreenville/OpenData/issues/17).

Got some ideas on how to make the site better? Catch us at a [Code for Greenville](http://codeforgreenville.org/) meetup, on Slack, or open an issue!
