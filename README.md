# HackGreenville.com

The official repository for Greenville, SC's tech community website, maintained by [Code for Greenville](https://github.com/codeforgreenville).    
    
[https://hackgreenville.com](https://hackgreenville.com/join-slack)
    
## Purpose 

Our goal is to connect people to the tech-related community in the Greenville area. We currently do this by providing information on meetups and tech organizations in the area, as well as directing people to the HackGreenville slack signup page.    
    
The meetup information is queried from the [Upstate Tech Cal Service](https://github.com/codeforgreenville/upstate_tech_cal_service).    
    
The organization information is queried from Code for Greenville's [API](https://github.com/codeforgreenville/OpenData/issues/17).
